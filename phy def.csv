"Phrase" ,"Meaning"
Scalar ,A scalar is a quantity which only has a magnitude – no direction.
Vector,A vector is a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: magnitude and direction
Displacment (s),Distance traveled in a particular direction (change in position)
"Velocity (u,v) ",Rate of change of displacement
Speed,Rate of change of distance
Acceleration,Rate of change of velocity
Newton's 1st law, An object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion remains in motion at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
Newton's 2nd law,An unbalanced force will cause an object to accelerate in the direction of the net force. The acceleration of the object is proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass. (Fnet = ma or Fnet =Δ p/Δ t (net force = rate of change of momentum))
Newton's 3rd law,"When two bodies A and B interact (push or pull), the force that A exerts on B is equal and opposite to the force that B exerts on A."
Translational Equilibrium,Net force acting on a body is zero
Linear Momentum (p),Product of mass and velocity
Impulse (J),Change in momentum
Law of consevartion of LM (c12),The total momentum of an isolated system (no external forces) remains constant.
Work,The product of a force on an object and the displacement of the object in the direction of the force.
Kinetic Energy ,Product of ½ times the mass of an object times the square of an object’s speed
Change in Gravitational Potential Energy,Poduct of an object’s mass times the gravitational field strength times the change in height
Principle of Conservation of Energy,The total energy of an isolated system (no external forces) remains constant. (OR – Energy can be neither created nor destroyed but only transformed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another.)
Elastic Collision,A collision in which kinetic energy is conserved
Inelastic Collision ,A collision in which kinetic energy is not conserved
Power (P),The rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred
Efficiency (eff),The ratio of the useful energy (or power or work) output to the total energy (or power or work) input
